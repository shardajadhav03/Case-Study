Array Operations
This web application allows users to visualize various array operations, including sorting algorithms. The page displays an array of bars representing numerical values, and users can perform operations such as generating a random array, sorting the array using different algorithms, and changing the size of the array.

Features
Generate Random Array: Clicking the "Generate Random Array" button creates a new array with 20 random integers.

Sorting Algorithms:

Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Bubble Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort
Shell Sort
Users can apply any of these sorting algorithms to visualize the step-by-step sorting process.
Change Array Size: Users can dynamically change the size of the array, prompting a new array generation with the specified size.

Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Interact with the buttons to perform array operations.

Visualization
Sorting algorithms are visualized by updating the display at each step of the process. The bars representing array elements move and change color during sorting, providing a visual representation of the algorithm's operation.
